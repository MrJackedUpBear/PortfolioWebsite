                    Hey! Welcome to my site! My name is Jonathan Taylor, and I am a Senior in college pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at Pittsburg State University.
                    I am 20 years old and have always been interested in computers. I have recently started my adventure in developing software. 
                    I only have a few projects, which I will discuss more in my projects tab, but I have thouroughly enjoyed the time I have spent developing software.
                    My main goal is to work with many different teams to learn more about development and meeting deadlines. 
                    Outside of my work aspirations, I plan on working on different open source projects including some I will develop and others
                    that I can assist with. If you want to know more. Just click <a href="https://portfolio.servername.win\About\">this</a> link for more information.
