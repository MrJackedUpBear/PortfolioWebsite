        <h2>General Information</h2>
        <p1>This website was created to display all of my personal information to the internet. In all seriousness, I created this website to show off some of the projects I have
            been working on, as well as my resume, and about information. This website has been really fun working with, and hopefully I can make it look even better.
            While I mainly enjoy working on backend environments, I did enjoy working on this webiste. I hope you enjoy this website and find it useful. Please let me know
            if you have any questions. Thank you again!
        </p1>
