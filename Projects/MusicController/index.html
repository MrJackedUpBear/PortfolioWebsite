    <h2>General Project Information</h2>
    <p1>Hello and welcome to the Music Controller Main Page! The source code is at the bottom if that is why you're here. Otherwise, I will be describing the project
        I have created, the purpose behind it, and the plans I have for this software. 
        <ol>
            <li>Currently, this code is kind of a jumbled mess, which I will attend to in my next iteration. This project's main fuction is to allow multiple users to log in
                to their music accounts to play music. The ideal setup for this software is to set it up in a general area with a speaker system, so that the users can go log
                in to their account and play music. The user is allowed to create an account, log in to their account, and play music from a music application of their choice.
                They can save their logins to a specified user in FireFox. Currently, this is only available with FireFox, so the user will have to create user profiles in
                FireFox that will save the logins for the users. The code is also very beta since the passwords, usernames, and security questions are not encrypted at all.

            </li>
            <li>
                This project was mainly created for personal use, so that I could have a whole music system set up in my house that allows new people to log in and play music, 
                without having to worry about logging in to their account each time. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Eventually, this project will feature a settings page to control where the music is played, the volume of the music, different queues for different users,
                and many other features. I will also be working with an API to provide a more cohesive music experience for the users. The main focus for the next iteration is
                security since currently this application offers no encryption for the user's input. I will focus on hashing the passwords, usernames, and security questions
                to ensure this is more secure for the end user. After completing the above, the main concept of the project will be complete, but I may make more tweaks later on.
            </li>
        </ol>
