            <h2>Music Controller Project</h2>
            <p>This project is a beta setup for a culmination of different processes. I worked with this project to focus on developing windows in an actual program, 
                work through different Java Frame processes to create an account, choose an account, display the accounts on the main page, and then play music after logging in.
                This project is not secure at all as it is a proof of concept project. There is no encryption for the usernames, passwords, or security questions. The main purpose
                of this project was to fully work with writing information to file and pull that information to display it for the user. Below are some screenshots to show what
                the project looks like. Please click the following link if you would like to learn more information about the project and see the code for it.

            <h2>Calculator in C#</h2>
            <p>This is another proof of concept idea I was working with. This is a simple calculator program in the terminal. The program will prompt the user to enter in
                an equation with the options of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentation, and fibonacci sequences. The program will take whatever
                input it is given and process it. This process will be described more in the link I will attach later. Ultimately, the program will take the input and calculate
                the answer to the user's equation and display it in the terminal. Below are a few screenshots of the program in action. Please click the following link for more information

            <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>Don't be alarmed. There is not another portfolio website. You are looking at it. This is all my creation, and it took me far longer than I would like to admit,
                but I am proud of what I have done. If you are interested in more information about this project, or just want to check out the source code, please click
