            <h2>Music Controller Project</h2>
            <p>This project is a beta setup for a culmination of different processes. I worked with this project to focus on developing windows in an actual program, 
                work through different Java Frame processes to create an account, choose an account, display the accounts on the main page, and then play music after logging in.
                The security of this project is fairly simple. I have a simple hashing method for the passwords, and use very simple encyrption for the music source passwords.
                The main purpose of this project was to fully work with writing information to file and pull that information to display it for the user. Below are some screenshots to show what
                the project looks like. Please click the following link if you would like to learn more information about the project and see the code for it.

            <h2>Calculator in C#</h2>
            <p>This is another proof of concept idea I was working with. This is a simple calculator program in the terminal. The program will prompt the user to enter in
                an equation with the options of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentation, and fibonacci sequences. The program will take whatever
                input it is given and process it. This process will be described more in the link I will attach later. Ultimately, the program will take the input and calculate
                the answer to the user's equation and display it in the terminal. Below are a few screenshots of the program in action. Please click the following link for more information

            <h2>API DBMS</h2>
            <p>This is a fun project that I am currently working on to show to a family owned business to help them with their inventory. Currently they do not have a system
                in place to keep track of their inventory, so I am working with a simple API that updates a database with their current inventory. I decided to make an API 
                because they requested this to be accessible from many different devices, which means an API would make this project work much better. I have setup a simple
                UI that allows the user to login, add to the inventory, delete from the inventory, and view the inventory. There is also a page to create another account,
                but it is blocked by permissions, so if the user does not have permission to do so, they will not be allowed to. Anyway, you can learn more at the project page:
                <a href=https://portfolio.servername.win\Projects\APIDBMS>API DBMS</a>. I will be adding more information about this project as I work on it, so please check back later.

            <h2>DTT Application</h2>
            <p>
                DTT stands for Discrete Trial Testing, and this is a type of testing method that is very helpful for learning material. I created this app for my brother since he is currently in his 
                Master's program and he wanted a quiz app that uses this specific testing method. This app is state of the art with a login page that allows the user to log in with a code sent to their email 
                or a password they can create. You can view the questions and edit them on the questions page, take a quiz, update your settings in the settings menu for the quiz time and number
                of questions. This is probably the most comprehensive app I have created. Check out the screenshots and other information on the dedicated page:

            <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
            <p>Don't be alarmed. There is not another portfolio website. You are looking at it. This is all my creation, and it took me far longer than I would like to admit,
                but I am proud of what I have done. If you are interested in more information about this project, or just want to check out the source code, please click
