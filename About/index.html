            <p1>
                Hey! Welcome to my site! My name is Jonathan Taylor, and I am a Junior in college pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at Pittsburg State University.
                I am 19 years old and have always been interested in computers. I have recently started my adventure in developing software. 
                I only have a few projects, which I will discuss more in my projects tab, but I have thouroughly enjoyed the time I have spent developing software.
                My main goal is to work with many different teams to learn more about development and meeting deadlines. 
                Outside of my work aspirations, I plan on working on different open source projects including some I will develop and others
                that I can assist with.
            </p1>

        <div class="job">
            <h1>Current Work</h1>
            <p1>
                Currently, I am working in the IT department at the college I am going to, Pittsburg State University. I am a part of the help desk and I have also helped 
                test the quality of software developed by the development team at Pitt State. My job includes helping students gain access to their accounts, updating client's 
                information, and general help.
            </p1>

        <div class="current">
            <h1>Current Goals and Focus</h1>
            <p1>
                Currently, I am working on developing different projects to showcase and improve my software development ability. I hope to land an internship soon, so I can gain some 
                experience with software development in the workforce and learn how to work with a team of software developers.
            </p1>

                My main goals for my career involve working for different types of software companies, so I can learn the best ways to develop software in different situations.
